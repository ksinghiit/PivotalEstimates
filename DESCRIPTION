Title: Pivotal-Based Inference for Block Progressively Censored Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kundan Singh
Maintainer: Kundan Singh 
Description: This package provides functions for performing pivotal-based
    parameter estimation under block progressive censoring schemes.
    It implements Monte Carlo based pivotal inference for estimating
    a common shape parameter and block-specific as well as pooled
    scale parameters of lifetime distributions. The methods are
    particularly useful in reliability analysis, life-testing
    experiments, and survival analysis involving progressively
    censored data.
